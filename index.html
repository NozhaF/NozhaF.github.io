		I am delighted that you could make it. Getting here wasn't easy, I know. In fact, I suspect it was a little tougher than you realize. To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble in an intricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you...Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle...Being you is not a gratifying experience at the atomic level...Still, you may rejoyce that it happens at all. Generally speaking in the universe it doesn't, so far as we can tell.
